Description: Our methods provide a way to assign continuous cell cycle
    phase using single-cell RNA-seq data, and consequently, allow for
    identication cyclic trend of gene expression levels along the cell
    cycle. This package provides method and training data, including
    single-cell RNA-seq data collected from 6 individual cell lines of
    induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and also continuous cell
    cycle phase derived from FUCCI fluorescence imaging data.
