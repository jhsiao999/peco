Description: Our methods provide a way to assign continuous cell cycle
    phase using single-cell RNA-seq data, and consequently, allow for
    identication cyclic trend of gene expression levels along the cell
    cycle. This package provides method and training data, including
    single-cell RNA-seq data collected from 6 individual cell lines of
    induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and also continuous cell
    cycle phase derived from FUCCI fluorescence imaging
    data. cycle_npreg_insample and cycle_npreg_outsample are the two
    main functions in peco. cycle_npreg_insample generates cyclic
    trend estimates of gene expression levels using training data, and
    cycle_npreg_outsample applies the estimates of
    cycle_npreg_insample to another gene expression dataset to infer
    an angle or cell cycle phase for each cell.
